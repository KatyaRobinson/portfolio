<div id="web-dev-love"> I want to be a web developer because:
			<ol>
				<li>Coding is fun! </li>
				<li>I like the challenge</li>
				<li>The ever changing nature of web development doesn't scare me, it excites me!</li>
				<li>The massive amount of different skills to learn guarantees that I will never get bored </li>
				<li>I've never seen a community as passionate about what they do as the web development community. These people bleed and breath code 24/7. Before I even done my first HTML tutorial, I felt like I belonged to this community and I ever since then it has been my goal to become a part of it.</li> </ol>
